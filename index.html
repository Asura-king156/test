            <h1>What happens when an IT professional and a pilot come together ?  </h1><h1>A homegrown burger chain is born.</h1>
            <p>Farman Beig and Rajat Jaiswal founded Wat-a-Burger in 2016 to offer Indian consumers a taste of fusion burgers in a market dominated by US fast food QSR chains. Wat-a-Burger’s desi recipes are suited for Indian palettes. The emphasis is on original Indian recipes and not tweaking existing flavours. Pudina chutney, Achari flavour, Makhani sauce, Spicy chilly are some of our key offerings.</p>
            <p>Starting a business was always on Farman and Rajat’s minds. While Farman was in England pursuing his MBA and Rajat was undergoing pilot training, both knew that once they were back in India, they would set up a business together.</p>
            <p>Since opening their first outlet in Noida Sector 18, Wat-a-Burger has scaled to more than 65 joints across 27 cities in over six years. This includes Delhi, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Guwahati, Lucknow, Patna, Ranchi, Muzaffarpur, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Kozhikode, and Gurgaon to name a few.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Burger Hut, where passion meets perfection. Our journey began with a simple idea: to create the best burger experience possible. Using only the freshest ingredients and the perfect grilling techniques, we aim to deliver a taste that is truly unforgettable.</p>
            <p>Whether you're a fan of classic flavors or adventurous enough to try something new, we have something for everyone. Our team is dedicated to ensuring every bite is as good as the last, and we can't wait to share our love for burgers with you.</p>
